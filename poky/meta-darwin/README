OpenEmbedded meta layer for darwin based SDKs

Notes: odcctools is not 64 bit safe and forces compiles to use -m32. You also need libobjc 
installed along with 32 bit libraries for ssl (libcrypto) and libuuid.
The odcctools2 version should be 64 bit safe and not need those workarounds.

You also need a OS-X sysroot tarball/zip file generated (copied) from a target OS-X
system. This is placed in the osx-runtime files directory and is used to compile the SDK
against it. It needs to contain the system libraries (/usr/lib) and include files 
(/usr/include).

This layer depends on:
